# Understanding Web Accessibility

## What is accessibility?

- “The inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites online by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.”
- accessibility --> a11y. Pronounced "a-eleven-y". Stands for the 11 letters between the a and the y.
- The absence of barriers to information
- Accessibility is good design. Making a website more accessible means it will be more usable for every user.
  - Some users have preferences for accessibility features (ex. Reduced motion)
  - Some accessibility features get adopted and widely used (ex. Background blur on video chat)

- Moral and ethical reasons to do so
  - You are a steward of access to information on the internet
  - The law makes this a basic human right to not be discriminated against, and access to information is a requirement for access to society
